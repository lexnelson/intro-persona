        <p>My name is Lex and I'm a student learning how to program</p>

            <p>I am originally from Northern Wisconsin but have spent the past few years living in Denver 
                Colorado, before recently moving out to South Carolina. I have a Fox Terrier named Fitz and 
                an ever-growing collection of house plants. Before deciding to learn programming I worked in 
                the customer service industry. </p>

        <button id="secondButton">why programming?</button>
        <div id ="bioTwo" style="display:none">
            <p>I am pursuing a career in programming because I feel this is where I will be most 
                sucessful both professionally and personally. In the Tech Industry there are an 
                abundance of opportunities, room for advancement, and spaces to create my own niche. 
                For me personally I have found the most fulfillment in my life while being challenged,
                 having an outlet for creativity, and while learning. I feel programming will offer
                  all of this and more to me.</p>

            <p>In my freetime I enjoy reading books, going running with my dog, and creating art projects. 
                I love spending time outside and have a goal of hiking the entire Pacific Crest Trail one day. 
                I am an avid podcast listener and am currently attempting to teach myself to play the ukulele. </p>
